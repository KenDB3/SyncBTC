/*KD3 Doors presents SyncBTC - A Bitcoin Exchange Rate external program (door) 
written in javascript for Synchronet BBS and ANSI capable terminals.

SyncBTC is based off of something cool I saw at BitSunrise.com (aka: Black Country Rock/Bit Sunrise). 
All of my code was original, but the look and feel of the app is based on the BCR original program: 
BCR Coins v1.0 - Real-time Bitcoin Price Module for Wildcat! and Winserver Bulletin Board Systems
I highly recommend you log into telnet://BitSunrise.com and check it out. 
You can see the conversation that started this project here:

All of the data is pulled from Coinbase.com and the queries used do not need any API Key.
So big thanks to Coinbase.com!

Also, thanks to http://www.xe.com/symbols.php for help with some of the currency symbols.

I didn't know if I could get this door working exactly the way I wanted, so I held off on 
developing it with GitHub. But, lo and behold, I got it working and I am pretty happy with
the results. I saved various stages of the work along the way, and so I am going to push 
my various snapshots of the work in Git to track some of the development. But the comments
on the commits are going to be little to nonexistant. Sorry about that.
