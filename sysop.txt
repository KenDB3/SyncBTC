I) About SyncBTC

A Bitcoin Exchange Rate external program (door) written in javascript for 
Synchronet BBS and ANSI capable terminals.

SyncBTC is a javascript application that gathers the current Bitcoin exchange 
rate as well as historic rates using the API from coinbase.com. It is 
designed to run on a Synchronet Bulletin Board System (BBS), and must be 
viewed with an ANSI capable terminal. This program was inspired by 
BCR Coins from BitSunrise.com (aka: Black Country Rock/Bit Sunrise).  
You can actually see the conversation that started this project here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/bbs/comments/4owbrt/bcr_coins_an_ansi_bitcoin_price_chart_generator/

The default currency is US Dollars (USD) for the first displayed exchange
rate as well as the chart of historic exchange rates. However, Sysops can 
choose what currency to base the first listed exchange rate and chart off. 
This customization is done for SBBS through modopts.ini (see setup below). 

Data coming from Coinbase.com does not require an API Key, thanks to the fact 
that only some simple queries are used. This makes it quicker and easier for 
Sysops to set up.

This door REQUIRES AN ANSI CAPABLE TERMINAL TO VIEW. It would be an utter 
mess without it due to many many cursor placements in the code. However, 
when you set up the External Door Config in SCFG, you can use line 7 to 
create an Access Requirement of ANSI which will restrict the door to users
with an ANSI terminal.

Other requirements for your callers include:
	Minimum Terminal Rows = 12
	Minimum Terminal Columns = 80

But, there is no Maximum size for Rows or Columns. In fact, I encourage you 
to try a bigger terminal. The biggest I tried was 470x165 (470 columns wide 
by 165 rows high) using PuTTY. The data on the chart should adapt 
accordingly. There is a binary animation that I call BitBomb. It happens 
before the Exchange Rate data is displayed. While the BitBomb looks cool, 
you can turn it off if you don't want it to display. I did have to put 
some code to limit it, though. When I tried out the excessively large 
terminal screen size of 470x165 it looked pretty great but took what seemed 
like an eternity to render. So, the animation is limited to 136x30. This 
seemed reasonable.

II) External Program Configuration

A) If you downloaded this as a ZIP file, extract the files to a folder in your
   /sbbs/xtrn/ directory. This doc assumes you named the folder "SyncBTC" 
   (ie. /sbbs/xtrn/SyncBTC/). 

B) Add the following section to your ctrl/modopts.ini file (typically located 
   at /sbbs/ctrl/modopts.ini):

[SyncBTC]
chartCurrency = USD
binaryAnimation = YES

1) Chart Currency
Change the entry for "chartCurrency = USD" to any currency found in the 
Coinbase.com API. You can look at the JSON response from this URL for options:
    https://api.coinbase.com/v2/currencies
	or this URL which is one of the actual queries SyncBTC uses...
	https://api.coinbase.com/v2/exchange-rates?currency=BTC
	You may have to tell your browser it can open the JSON file, or just 
	download 	the file and open it with a Text Editor like Notepad++, 
	Notepad2, Windows Notepad, etc....
	You can cross reference what you find there with this list:
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217
	But occasionally Coinbase.com will create codes where none exist, for
	example: BTC represents Bitcoin, and that isn't an official ISO_4217 code.

	Some Examples of Common Currencies:
	USD - for United States Dollars
	CAD - for Canadian Dollars
	EUR - for Eurozone Euros
	GBP - for British Pound
	AUD - for Australian Dollar
	NZD - for New Zealand Dollar
	JPY - for Japanese Yen
	CNY - for Chinese Yuan
	CHF - for Swiss Franc
	MXN - for Mexican Peso
	ARS - for Argentina Peso

Example of British Pound for your currency would be:
chartCurrency = GBP

NOTE: No quotes are needed in the modopts.ini section you added. 

2) Binary Animation (BitBomb)
Change the entry for "binaryAnimation = YES" to be a "NO" if you do not want 
the animation of 1s and 0s before the data is displayed. I added it just as 
something cool to watch before you get the data displayed. The animation is
actually happening before the lookup and processing of the data, so, in effect
it is actually slowing down the application. But, again, I thought it looked
pretty good and made the app more interesting. Again, to turn it off you need
to enter "NO" specifically. An "N" will not suffice. Example of it off:
binaryAnimation = NO
   
C) Set up the External Door via Synchornet Configuration, External Programs

[bitcoin.js]
 1: Name                       Bitcoin Exchange Rate
 2: Internal Code              SYNCBTC
 3: Start-up Directory         ../xtrn/SyncBTC/
 4: Command Line               ?bitcoin.js
 5: Clean-up Command Line      
 6: Execution Cost             None
 7: Access Requirements        ANSI
 8: Execution Requirements     
 9: Multiple Concurrent Users  Yes
10: Intercept Standard I/O     No
11: Native (32-bit) Executable No
12: Use Shell to Execute       No
13: Modify User Data           No
14: Execute on Event           No
15: Pause After Execution      No
16: BBS Drop File Type         None
17: Place Drop File In         Node Directory
18: Time Options...

NOTE: This door is *HEAVILY RELIANT* on the user's terminal supporting ANSI. 
However, if you want it to also be used as a Logon Event, make sure that you 
are setting #7, Access Requirements, to be "ANSI" as instructed above. Then 
you can change #14, "Execute on Event", accordingly. 
Example:
14: Execute on Event           Logon
Which makes it a door you can run from Externals as well as a Logon Event
or...
14: Execute on Event           Logon, Only
Which makes it Only a Logon Event
